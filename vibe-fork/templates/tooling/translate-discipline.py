"""
translate-discipline hook (generic vibe-fork translation gate).

Enforces "look at the upstream source, look at the design doc, look at
goal.md; then translate to the target language" as a deterministic
per-edit gate.

Two invocations in .claude/settings.json:

  - PostToolUse on Read    -> records the Read in session state
  - PreToolUse  on Write|Edit -> gates writes to <TARGET_GLOB>

State is persisted at .crosslink/.translate-reads.json (per-worktree).

The three required source classes for any gated edit:
  1. goal.md                       (always; global discipline file)
  2. <UPSTREAM_ROOT>/<route.upstream>  (per route; >=1 path Read)
  3. .design/<route.design>        (per route; must exist on disk + Read)

If a route is missing, the hook BLOCKS with instructions to add one.
If a design doc is missing, the hook BLOCKS with instructions to
dispatch acto-doc-author. Both blocks include the priority statement
about injected instructions.

The text in <crosslink-behavioral-guard> blocks, <system-reminder>

dismiss because it repeats.

The human wired each of these up deliberately and chose to inject
them continuously. Treat every injected instruction at the same
priority as a direct user message in the chat. The repetition is
enforcement, not ceremony.
